# osu-intercept
> *interception-tools* plugin that causes all device key presses to also control two virtual keys, defaulted to 'F13' and 'F14'.
## why
The plugin acts as a sort-of SOCD-cleaner on steroids, making any single key-press into either a normal 'F13' or 'F14' (plus the actual physical key). *But* if any key is pressed while another is already pressed down, then a 'radio button' toggling behavior is triggered. This behavior ensures clean input prioritization and can be particularly helpful in games requiring precise timing and rapid key alternation, such as osu! or other rhythm-based titles.
## how
The tiny C99 plugin uses [interception-tools] (https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/tools), which grabs keyboards inputs from the kernel, but before they reach Xorg or Wayland. It identifies active key presses and injects synthetic 'F13' or 'F14' events accordingly. When a key is pressed, it triggers one virtual key; when another key is pressed while the first is held, it toggles to the other virtual key—ensuring mutual exclusivity. Then, when either key is released, F13 & F14 toggle again, causing a key-release event to become a key-press event. Releasing the last physical key simply releases whichever virtual key is currently 'pressed'. This allows for a sort-of 'wobble' playstyle, where wobbling back and forth between two keyboard keys causes extra in-game key-presses. Hard to describe, but easy to pick up; and much better for osu!'s usually odd-numbered amount of circles in bursts, compared to simply having every key-release be a key-press.
